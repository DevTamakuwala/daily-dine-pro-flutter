# Project Changes

This file documents the recent changes made to the Daily Dine Pro Flutter application.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Forgot Password Feature**: A "Forgot Password?" button has been added to the login screen (`lib/Screens/Auth/LoginForm.dart`). Tapping this button will navigate the user to a new screen where they can reset their password. This improves user experience by providing a way for users to regain access to their accounts if they have forgotten their password.

### Changed
- **Default Signup Form**: The default user type on the registration screen (`lib/Screens/Auth/SignupForm.dart`) has been changed from "Mess Owner" to "Customer". This change was made to prioritize the more common user type and streamline the registration process for customers.
